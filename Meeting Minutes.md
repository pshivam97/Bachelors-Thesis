# Meeting Minutes

## Guide/Advisor
Prof. Somnath Biswas

## Meeting-1 | 15th August 2019

### Points Discussed
- Read about NSGA-I,II,III in order to understand how these MOEAs were developed over time.
- Run NSGA-II code only in data space on some complicated MOOP.
- Run NSGA-II initially for some generations only in data space, and then in both, data and objective space on some complicated MOOP.

## Meeting-2 | 19th August 2019

### Points Discussed
- Read about **Constrained Optimization problems** from Kalyanmoy Deb's book, and understand what exactly *"constrained"* means in this context.
- Fast (poly-time) sampling algorithms for a **convex feasible region** can be implemented while generating the random population.
